Hello everyone. I know some of you watch my videos to practice English. So today I wanted to share some more tips on learning English.

So since I'm a native speaker, I can't say that I've learned English this way, but this is how I learned Chinese.

When I first started learning Chinese, I didn't have anyone around me to practice with or nobody to learn from.

And I didn't even live in a Chinese-speaking environment.

I didn't understand anything.

But I constantly watched Chinese movies, listened to music, and listened to Chinese podcasts.

I even searched for those language meditation videos and listened to Chinese while I slept.

A lot of people don't believe me when I say I listen to Jay Chou to practice my Chinese pronunciation.

But I would listen to his songs while following along with the Chinese words, and then I would listen to them so many times that I could literally sing along without even knowing what it meant.

I did my best to create a Chinese environment for myself.

So even when I played video games, I would change the language settings to Chinese.

And when I watched Chinese movies, I would pause after every line they said to write it down and start to understand word by word.

And then sentence by sentence.

I even started dreaming in Chinese, which got pretty interesting.

I mean, imagine your mom or someone comes up in your dream and suddenly starts speaking English or some other language that she doesn't know in real life.

It was totally shocking.

Then I signed up for Chinese classes in college.

Everyone around me at this time said that it would be impossible for me to learn a language later on in life.

And they said the Chinese college courses required way too much effort, and they all thought I would fail.

But to be honest, I felt passionate enough about Chinese so I worked really hard and eventually it became my best subject in school.

It was also a really good way for me to create learning goals.

So whether it be preparing for a test or a presentation, and after I did a good job, it would motivate me even more to keep learning.

Learning a language is just like learning any other skill, like basketball or drawing.

Everything takes time and effort before you can see improvements.

For me, I started learning Chinese purely out of my own interest.

But I know that might not be the case for all of you.

So maybe you need to take it for Gao Kao, or maybe you need to take IELTS.

But I think if you can find some fun and interesting ways of learning, then it'll make it seem less like a chore.

I believe that this method would work for any learner at any age, and I truly believe it's never too late to start learning something new.
